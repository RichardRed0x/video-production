| 6 | ![shot 6](../decredUnique/img/shot_6.svg) | **VO**:<br />For starters, both Bitcoin and Decred have a 21 million coin supply cap.<br />**Action**:<br />Yellow lines stretch up first, followed by blue lines. | 0:13 |
| 7 | ![shot 7](../decredUnique/img/shot_7.svg) | **VO**:<br />Here's where things get interesting. Bitcoin's block reward is reduced by 50 percent every 4 years as shown by this stepped graph.<br />**Action**:<br />All lines start at same top height, then fall down. Camera pans right. | 0:17 |
| 8 | ![shot 8](../decredUnique/img/shot_8.svg) | **VO**:<br />Decred's block reward is reduced smoothly and gradually by 1% every 21 days as shown by this curve.<br />**Action**:<br />All lines start at same top height, then fall down. Camera zooms out. | 0:26 |
| 9 | ![shot 9](../decredUnique/img/shot_9.svg) | **VO**:<br />New Bitcoin blocks are found and broadcast by proof-of-work miners, who also receive 100% of the Bitcoin block reward. Decred blocks are found and broadcast by proof-of-work miners who only receive part of the Decred block reward. Here's why:<br />**Action**:<br />Black lines move up from bottom to show PoW Reward portions. | 0:33 |
| 10 | ![shot 10](../decredUnique/img/shot_10.svg) | **VO**:<br />Decred utilizes a hybrid proof-of-work - proof-of-stake protocol<br />**Action**:<br /> Miner animation in, then PoS animation in. | 0:47 |
| 11 | ![shot 11](../decredUnique/img/shot_11.svg) | **VO**:<br />where 90% of Decred's block reward is split between<br />**Action**:<br />Gray circle animates in pushing the other icons outward. 90% wedge increases size and turns dark gray to highlight. | 0:52 |

| 14 | ![shot 14](../decredUnique/img/shot_14.svg) | **VO**:<br />Miners receive 60% of the total block reward for finding Decred blocks while Voters<br />**Action**:<br />60% wedge and miner highlight blue. The 40% portion of wedge reduces to initial size. | 1:00 |
| 15 | ![shot 15](../decredUnique/img/shot_15.svg) | **VO**:<br />receive 30% for casting on-chain votes.<br />**Action**:<br />40% wedge size increases and turns blue. 60% wedge size decreases and turns gray. | 1:04 |
| 16 | ![shot 16](../decredUnique/img/shot_16.svg) | **VO**:<br />It works like this:<br />**Action**:<br />Miner moves to center. Pie chart and PoS animate out. | 1:07 |

| 21 | ![shot 21](../decredUnique/img/shot_21.svg) | **VO**:<br />are used to decide whether<br />**Action**:<br />Votes condense and block moves right to 'absorb them'. The block turns blue and begins to 'fall' | 1:17 |
