Decred coin with 4 blue/green circuits extending from it on a deep blue background. The Decred coin 'unplugs' from the circuit to reveal a Bitcoin beneath it. Two of the circuits turn grey, the other two turn orange/yellow. The Decred coin 'plugs' back in and all circuits return to blue/green. | Decred is a cryptocurrency which builds upon the strengths of Bitcoin. To see how Decred is unique, let's compare the two.
Text: Decred & Bitcoin supply cap = 21 million coins | Both Bitcoin and Decred have a 21 million coin supply cap. Here's where things get interesting.
Orange/yellow stepped graph of Bitcoin mining subsidy over time. A Bitcoin falls down the steps. | Bitcoin's mining subsidy is reduced by 50 percent every 4 years as shown by this stepped graph.
Blue/green curved graph of Decred mining subsidy over time. A Decred coin slowly rolls down the curve. | Decred reduces its mining subsidy smoothly and gradually by 1% every 21 days as shown by this curve.
An orange/yellow block. | New bitcoin blocks are found and broadcast

An avatar wearing an orange/yellow baseball cap presents empty hands. | Leaving users without a way to coordinate and change the rules regarding what blocks are considered valid.
A chain of Bitcoin blocks builds across the screen forking in two directions as it goes. | This leaves open the possibility for hard forks in the chain.
A blue legal scale weighing decred miners (avatars wearing blue/green mining helmets) and stakers (avatars wearing blue/green baseball caps and 'I voted' pins). The stakers have more weight than the miners. | Decred aims to improve on this by implementing a system of checks and balances on its proof-of-work miners, giving its users more say in Decred's development. It works like this.
A Blue/green block | Once a new Decred block 
Decred miner avatar presents a Decred block |is found by a proof-of-work miner,
5 stake voters appear opposite to the miner| the validity of that block is decided by a consensus vote cast by 5 stake voters.
The voters votes are cast represented by red thumbs down for no and green thumbs up for yes. 3 of 5 of the votes are no, and the block is highlighted red and is taken away. | If a majority vote deeming the block is not achieved, the newly found block is immediately rejected by the network.
The miner presents a new block and voters again vote on the validity of the block. This time 4 out of 5 votes are 'yes'. The block is highlighted green. | If a block is deemed valid,
Decred coin in the middle with 60% and 30% on either side. 1 miner underneat the 60% and 5 stake voters underneath the 30% | then the new minted Decred coins are split 60-30. 60% goes to the proof-of-work miner for finding the block and 30% goes to the stake voters for doing their part to secure the chain.
Decred block chain builds accross the screen. It forks as it goes, but the old chains end with a red X. | Decred's hybridized mining system makes sure that its chain will never split. The differences don't stop there.
30% with 5 stake voters underneath, 60% with three miners underneath, and 10% with a blue/green piggy bank underneath. | 10% of every Decred block reward is placed in the Decred development fund.
Blue/green piggy bank with two hands underneath. One hand is holding USD, the other a bag of Bitcoin. The hands throw the USD and BTC off screen. | The Development fund makes Decred a self-funded open-source project with no need for outside capital or an ICO. How the development fund is spent is determined by the community.
An iMac type computer with a web-browser open. The cursor moves to vote yes or no, then select a development team represented by avatars wearing blue/green glasses.| Through the project proposal website, Users get to vote on ideas to improve the network and select the development team to complete them.
