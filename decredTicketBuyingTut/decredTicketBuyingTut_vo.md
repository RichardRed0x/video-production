## How To Buy Decred Tickets
### Voice Over Script

In this video, we are going to walk through buying Decred tickets with the Decrediton wallet, step-by-step. 

First, head to Decred.org and download the Decrediton wallet for your platform and install. On first run, Decrediton will begin to download the Decred blockchain. Grab a cup of coffee and wait. This could take a few minutes.

After the blockchain downloads, you see your seed phrase - the mathematically unique secret key to your Decred wallet. In the event that you can no longer access your Decrediton wallet on the computer you are currently working on, your seed phrase can be used to restore all of your Decred accounts and keys. Under no circumstances should your seed phrase be shared with anyone! Anyone in possession of your seed phrase will have full access to your Decred funds! Write your seed phrase down on a piece of paper exactly in the order it is shown, including caps and lowercase, store it somewhere safe, and do not lose it! A lost seed phrase can potentially mean the loss of your Decred funds.

Once you have copied your seed phrase, click ‘continue’ and you will be prompted to confirm your seed. 

Next, create a passphrase which will be used to confirm transactions from your wallet as well as to encrypt the local wallet file. Make sure to use a high-security passphrase and keep it in a secure place. 

Now that you have confirmed your seed and passphrase, click ‘Create Wallet’ and wait while your wallet syncs to the blockchain. 

Once your wallet fully syncs to the blockchain you’ll see the ‘Overview’ screen. Since you have created a new seed, you will need to deposit your Decred funds into your Decrediton wallet before you can purchase tickets.

If you have not already purchased Decred, you can do so on exchanges listed at on the Decred website. Click the card above to go there now.

To deposit Decred into your Decrediton wallet,  you will need your public wallet address located under the ‘Transactions’ tab.

On the Transactions screen, click the ‘Receive’ tab at the top to see  your wallet address. Simply copy and paste this address into the “Send To” field of your exchange withdrawal dialog to deposit your funds into Decrediton.

Now that your funds are in your Decrediton wallet, verify that you have enough to purchase a ticket. The current ticket price can be found at dcrdata.org. If you have enough, then it's time to buy some tickets! To do so, click on the ‘Tickets’ tab.

Under the ‘Tickets’ tab, you will be asked to enter your stake server information.

A stake server is a service that will handle the voting of your ticket on your behalf, freeing you from worry of losses due to computer downtime. 

Some things to consider when choosing a stake server are: *(1)* security of the stake server, *(2)* support provided by the server, *(3)* the fee charged by the stake server, and *(4)* proportion of the votes cast by a single server compared to the total votes of the network. 

Proportion of votes is important to consider since in order to keep the network decentralized, it is best to pick a server that has less than 5% of the total network votes. 

A list of recommended stake servers with corresponding stats including network proportion can be found at decred.org/stakepools. Choose a stake pool then head to their site to create an account. 

Once your stakepool account is created you will be shown your API key. Copy and paste your key into the API Key field in Decrediton and click: ‘Add’.
After Decrediton is properly connected to your stake pool the ‘Purchase Tickets’ Screen will appear.  

Before you purchase a ticket, head over to the ‘Governance’ tab.

The governance tab shows which upgrade proposals are currently being voted on and allows you to choose your vote concerning each. You can vote yes, no, or abstain. Choose your preferences for each  and then head back to the Purchase Tickets tab.

Under the Purchase Tickets heading, choose the account you would like to use to purchase tickets and the amount desired. Beneath this form you can see settings for the ticket purchase, such as what stake pool will be voting on your behalf, the fees you will pay to purchase the ticket, and how many blocks your ticket will wait in the mempool before expiring. These four settings can be changed by clicking the gear icon at the top, but for the majority of users, the defaults will work fine. 

Once ready, click: ‘Purchase’. Simple! 

It will take on average 30 days for your ticket to be drawn. After your staked funds are unlocked they can be used to purchase more tickets.

To make the re-buying of tickets effortless, Decrediton allows for automatic ticket purchasing. Just below the Purchase Tickets section in the purchase tickets tab is the ‘Automatic Purchase’ section. Auto ticket purchasing parameters can be modified by clicking the gear icon to the right, but the defaults should suffice.  

All you need to do is click the toggle and Decrediton will automatically purchase more tickets as your funds become available

Now just sit back and watch your ticket rewards come in!
