
Decred is a cryptocurrency which builds upon the strengths of bitcoin. To see how Decred is unique, let's compare the two.

Both Bitcoin and Decred have a 21 million coin supply cap.

Here's where things get interesting.

Bitcoin's mining subsidy is reduced by 50 percent every 4 years as shown by this stepped graph.

Decred reduces its mining subsidy smoothly and gradually by 1% evry 21 days as shown by this curve.

New Bitcoin blocks are found and broadcast by proof-of-work miners, who also recieve 100% of the Bitcoin reward. This gives miners all the power, leaving users without a way to coordinate and change the rules regarding what blocks are considered valid. This leaves open the possibility for hard forks in the chain.

Decred aims to improve on this by implementing a system of checks and balances on its proof-of-work miners, giving its users more say in Decred's development.

It works like this:

Once a new decred block is found by a proof-of-work miner, the validity of that block is decided by a consensus vote cast by 5 stake voters. If a majority vote deeming the block valid is not achieved, the newly found block is immediately rejected by the network. If a block is deemed valid, then the new minted Decred coins are split 60-30. 60% goes to the proof-of-work miners for finding the block and 30% goes to the stake voters for doing their part to secure the chain. Decred's hybridized mining system makes sure that its chain will never split.

The differences don't stop there.

10% of every Decred block is placed in the Decred development fund. The development fund makes Decred a self-funded open source project with no need outside capital or an ICO.

How the development fund is spen is determined by the users. Through the project proposal website, users get to vote on ideas to improve the network and select the development team to complete them.

Decred is controlled by the community. To join the Decred community, go to Decred.org to download the user software for you rplatoform and get Decred on exhanges such as Bittrex and Poloniex.
