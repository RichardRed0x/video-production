Decred's unique proof-of-stake system allows stakeholders to vote with their coins to secure the network and participate in its governance.

To participate in the proof-of-stake voting system, stakeholders lock a portion of their coins in exchange for a ticket. 

Purchased tickets are placed in the ticket pool where they wait to be randomly drawn.

Once a ticket is drawn, the ticket holder's votes are cast by their chosen stake server; a service which provides the infrastructure to ensure ticket holder's votes are broadcast to the network swiftly.

Without joining a stake server, a ticket holder must make sure that their own Decred server is ready at all times to broadcast their votes. This can sometimes be impractical, especially in situations where internet connections may be unreliable.

The votes cast by ticket holders are essential to the security of the Decred network and its governance. 

The 5 votes mined into each new block determine the validity of the previous one. If the previous block is deemed invalid, the transactions and proof-of-work portion of the block reward are stripped from the network, punishing the miner for mining an invalid block. 

The proof-of-stake portion, on the other hand, is always paid out to the 5 voters. This way voters are compensated for stopping miner attacks and preventing unwanted chain forks by rejecting blocks that break the consensus rules.

Decisions regarding consensus rule changes and network updates are also made by ticket holders through an on-chain decision-making system. Through this system stakeholders have already voted to change the algorithm responsible for setting the price of a ticket as well as to prepare the network for lightning transactions. 

What's more, cryptographic ticket "receipts" are used to verify ticket holders and allow them to interface with Politeia; Decred's chain-anchored proposal system. Through Politeia, users can participate in Decred self-governance by voting to determine which Decred improvement projects receive funding from the development fund.

After a ticket holder's various votes have been cast, their locked coins used to purchase their ticket are unlocked and their proof-of-stake reward is credited to their account. They can then choose to purchase another ticket, or spend their funds elsewhere.

Thanks to its proof-of-stake voting system, Decred is an autonomous self-funded crypto-currency where stakeholders make the rules.
