Decred's unique stake voting system allows users to vote with their coins to reinforce the network, choose the direction of its evolution, and earn more coins.

To participate in the proof-of-stake mining system, you lock a portion of your coins in exchange for a ticket. Once your ticket votes, your locked coins become spendable again and you receive new minted coins as reward. 

Tickets are chosen to vote randomly using arbitrary entropy generated by the blockchain.

When your vote is drawn, it is cast by your configured stake server.

Stake servers stand by 24/7 to ensure your votes are counted and rewards are earned, eliminating losses due to computer downtime or bad Internet connections.

In rare cases, votes are missed when miners are processing blocks faster than the votes can propagate through the network. 

When this happens, it is possible for blocks with only 3 or 4 votes out of the required 5 to be added to the chain. If a block is mined with less than 5 votes, the remaining votes destined for that block are considered ‘missed’. No rewards are given for missed tickets, but the coins used to purchased them are unlocked and returned to the purchaser.

These 5 votes included in each new block are integral to the integrity of the network in a few ways. 

The validity of the previously mined block is determined by stake votes. If the previous block is deemed invalid, the transactions and miner portion of the block reward is stripped from the network. Ticket rewards, on the other hand, are always awarded, whether a block is deemed valid or not. 

Through the block validation process, stakeholders can prevent miners from withholding blocks or trying a 51% attack. Because every mined block requires stakeholder approval, it is impossible for a rogue fork to become longer than 2 blocks.

Decisions regarding the implementation of upgrades and consensus rule changes to the Decred network are also determined through stake voting. This was how the rules were upgraded to improve the efficiency of the ticket pricing algorithm, and can also be used to implement other network changes such as compatibility with new protocols and the altering of block size.

Cryptographic ticket "receipts" are used to verify and allow stake voters to interface with Politeia; Decred's chain-anchored proposal system. Through Politeia, stake voters can participate in Decred self-governance by submitting and voting on proposals about how to spend the Development fund.

The rate of return on investment in Decred's stake voting system can be determined using ticket price, time taken for an individual ticket to cast its vote, and amount of coins earned as reward.

The price of a ticket is automatically adjusted in order to maintain the ideal amount of tickets in what is called the ticket pool. If the ticket pool contains more than the optimum 40,960 tickets, the price to purchase a ticket will increase. Conversely, if there are too few tickets in the ticket pool, the price will decrease.

The lifetime of a ticket varies due to the random nature of voting order. Statistically, most tickets will be drawn within 5 months, but on average one will only wait 1 month. 

The amount of coins earned in return one is directly proportional to the current block reward. Each vote will earn 6% of the total block reward per vote. As the block reward decreases by 1% every 21 days, so does the value of that 6%. 

Based on this information and taking into account the decreasing value of the ticket reward over time, an annual percentage rate of 15% can be expected from stake voting.

Best of all, that 15% comes risk free; staked coins are always unlocked whether your ticket successfully votes, or not.
