Decred's unique stake voting system secures the blockchain and offers a lucrative opportunity to investors. By voting with their coins, investors earn DCR at 15% APR for reinforcing the network and choosing the direction of its evolution.

Stake voting is a form of proof-of-stake mining. To participate,
you lock a portion of your coins in exchange for a ticket. Once your ticket votes, your locked coins become spendable again and you receive new minted coins as reward. 

Tickets are chosen to vote randomly using arbitrary entropy generated by the blockchain.

When your vote is drawn, it is cast by your configured stake server.

Stake servers stand by 24/7 to make sure your votes are counted and your rewards are earned. This allows the casting of votes without worry of losses due to computer downtime or bad Internet connections. In return, stake servers receive a small fee taken out of your reward. This server fee helps pay for infrastructure needed to ensure votes are cast quickly and reliably.

In rare cases, it is possible for votes to be missed even though they were cast. This can happen when miners are processing blocks faster than the votes can propagate through the network. 

Miners are required to include 5 votes in each block, however, it is possible for only 3 or 4 votes to be included if multiple blocks are found in quick succession. If a block is mined with less than the required 5 votes, the remaining votes destined for that block are considered ‘missed’ and the funds used to purchase them are unlocked and returned to their owners.

Votes cast through stake voting system are vital to the integrity of the Decred network.

The 5 votes contained in each new block are used to determine the validity of the previous block. If this previous block is deemed invalid by at least a 3 to 5 majority, *then all of its transactions and proof-of-work miner reward are stripped from the network while the voters' ticket rewards are retained.* 

*This process acts as a check on miner power, giving stakeholders a way to direct the rules of the network and prevent miners from misbehaving by withholding blocks or trying to modify the chain with a 51% attack. Because every block is created by miners but requires stakeholder approval, the largest reorganization of the chain that can occur is just 2 blocks.*

Tickets also vote concerning other agenda items up for a community vote such as any consensus rule upgrades being proposed. All of the code needed for the upgrade will already be built and ready for Decred stake holder approval. This was how the rules were upgraded to improve the efficiency of the ticket pricing algorithm, it's how the Decred will be upgraded to become compatible with lightning network, and it can also be used to change the size of Decred blocks, if the community desires.

What's more, cryptographic ticket "receipts" are used to verify and allow stake voters to interface with Politeia; Decred's chain-anchored proposal system. *Through Politeia, stake voters can participate in Decred self-governance by proposing issues for the community to vote on and voting on those proposed by others.*

The rate of return on investment in Decred's stake voting system can be determined by considering the price of a ticket, the time it takes for an individual ticket to cast its vote, and the amount of coins earned as reward.

The price of a ticket is automatically adjusted so that the right amount of tickets are waiting to be chosen in what is called the ticket pool. If the ticket pool contains more than the optimum 40,960 tickets, the price to purchase a ticket will increase. An increased ticket price will discourage ticket buying and allow the number of tickets in the pool to shrink. If there are too few tickets in the ticket pool, the price will decrease to kick-start investment and fill the pool.

The lifetime of a ticket varies due to the random nature of voting order, however, each ticket has a 99.5% chance of being drawn from the pool within 5 months. On average, a ticket will only wait for a month. 

Lastly, the amount of coins earned is proportional to the current block reward. The proof-of-stake portion of the block reward is split between the 5 votes contained in each block. This works out to 6% of the total block reward per vote. 

Taking this information into account and including other variables such as the decreasing block reward over time, an annual percentage rate of 15% can be expected from stake voting.

Best of all, that 15% comes risk free; staked coins are always unlocked whether your ticket successfully votes, or not.
