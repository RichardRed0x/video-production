2 | "Map" of Decred PoS voting sytem which with nodes representing proposal voting, block voting, and consensus voting. | Decred's unique proof-of-stake system allows stakeholders to secure the network, participate in its governance, and change consensus rules by voting with their coins. | 10
3 | Coins are locked in a vault and a ticket is dispensed. | To take part in the proof-of-stake voting system, stakeholders lock a portion of their coins in exchange for a ticket. | 9
4 | A ticket falls into a square machine with 5 digital displays. The top is is labeled *tix in pool* and changes from *40959* to *40960*, the bottom five are labeled *winners* and read *00000*. Besides the machine is a digital clock that reads *4:04pm*.  | All tickets are placed in the ticket pool where they wait to be randomly selected. | 7
5 | The clock turns to *4:05pm* and the 5 *winners* displays begin randomly showing numbers between *00000* and *40960*, slower and slower until they stop on a number. | Every 5 minutes, 5 tickets are drawn from the pool. | 4 
6| Network "map" with voting service providers represented as servers. 5 of the servers broadcast votes to the network. | Once their ticket is drawn, a ticket holder's votes are cast by their chosen vote casting service which provides the infrastructure to ensure votes are broadcast to the network swiftly. | 12
7 | Sheild and greek library. | The votes cast by ticket holders are essential to the security and governance of the Decred network. | 8
8 | A block is added to a chain. 5 votes (thumbs up/down) pop out of the block and deem the previous one invalid by 4/1. The previous block turns red and falls out of the chain. | The votes mined into each new block check the mining behavior demonstrated in the previous block. If a majority determine this behavior to be unwanted then the miner is punished by not receiving his block reward. | 17
9 | Miner, 5 voters, and blockchain. The voters vote the new block valid. Both miner and voters recieve rewards. New miner and voters. Voters vote the block unwanted. Miner gets no reward, voters do. | By rejecting unwanted blocks that break the consensus rules, stakevoters stop miner attacks and prevent unwanted chain forks. | 12
10 | Ballot box with a lightning bolt on it. Amount of votes (yes, no, abstain) are counted on the box. Above, a new block is added to the chain and 5 votes fall into the ballot box. As the votes fall in the vote counts rise. | Decisions regarding consensus rule changes and network upgrades are also made by voters through an on-chain decision-making system. Through this system stakeholders have already voted to prepare the network for lightning transactions. | 20
