1 | ![Shot 1](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_1.svg) | Decred proof-of-stake | 3 
2 | ![Shot 2](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_2.svg) | is an on-chain decision making system | 5 
3 | ![Shot 3](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_3.svg) | Where participants purchase tickets for a chance to have their voice heard. | 6 
4 | ![Shot 4](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_4.svg) | to purchase a ticket, participants must have enough Decred to cover the current ticket price. | 3 
5 | ![Shot 5](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_5.svg) | Every 144 blocks, a new ticket price is calculated by a pricing algorithm to keep the total number of active tickets equal to the target size. | 3 
6 | ![Shot 6](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_6.svg) | If the participant's balance is high enough, a portion equal to the current ticket price may be locked in exchange for a ticket. | 7
7 | ![Shot 7](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_7.svg) | Locked funds can not be spent for the duration of the ticket lifecycle. The exact length of a specific ticket's life is largely up to chance, but averages 30 days. | 5 
8 | ![Shot 8](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_8.svg) | A ticket's life begins after it is mined into a block. How long a ticket must wait to be mined is determined by the ticket fee paid when it was purchased. Once included in a block, a ticket is considered immature and must wait about 12 hours before it becomes live and is added to the ticket pool. | 3 
9 |  ![Shot 9](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_9.svg) | The ticket pool is where live tickets wait to be chosen to vote. Every 5 minutes, using arbitrary entropy from the blockchain, 5 tickets are randomly drawn from the pool to vote. | 3
10 | ![Shot 10](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_10.svg) | Once their ticket is drawn, a participant's votes must be broadcast to the network for inclusion in the next block. Participants have 2 options for broadcasting their votes. They can broadcast their votes themselves which requires running their own node 24/7, ready and waiting to broadcast the moment their ticket is drawn. Or, a voting service provider can be employed to broadcast on their behalf. | 5
11 | ![Shot 11](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_11.svg) | There are two on-chain voting processes to participate in: block votes and consensus votes. | 7 
12 | ![Shot 12](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_12.svg) | Block votes provide a mechanism for participants to keep nonconforming proof-of-work miners in check. | 8 
13 | ![Shot 13](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_13.svg) | 5 votes in each new block decide whether to reject the previous block. If the block is rejected, the founding miner will not receive their part of the block reward. | 8 
14 | ![Shot 14](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_14.svg) | Consensus voting is a two stage process where participants vote for or against the implementation of changes to the Decred network. | 5 
15 | ![Shot 15](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_15.svg) | if enough nodes upgrade within the upgrade phase interval, voting commences. If 75% of votes signal yes within the voting interval, then the changes are ratified and will be automatically implemented after another block interval. | 5 
16 | ![Shot 16](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_16.svg) | After a participant's block and consensus votes have been cast, the funds used to purchase the ticket are unlocked and a portion of the block reward is credited to their account. | 7
17 |  ![Shot 17](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_17.svg) | Other decisions not involving consensus rule changes, such as how to spend the project subsidy fund are decided through Politeia, the Decred proposal system. | 7 
18 |  ![Shot 18](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_18.svg) | Through their wallet, participants with live tickets can vote to approve or deny Politeia proposals. | 7
