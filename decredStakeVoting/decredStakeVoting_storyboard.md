1 | ![Shot 1](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_1.svg) | Decred proof-of-stake | 3 
2 | ![Shot 2](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_2.svg) | is an on-chain decision making system | 5 
3 | ![Shot 3](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_3.svg) | Where participants purchase tickets for a chance to have their voice heard. | 6 
4 | ![Shot 4](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_4.svg) | to purchase a ticket, participants must have enough Decred to cover the current ticket price. | 3 
5 | ![Shot 5](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_5.svg) | Every 144 blocks, a new ticket price is calculated by a pricing algorithm to keep the total number of active tickets equal to the target size. | 3 
6 | ![Shot 6](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_6.svg) | if the participant's balance is high enough, a portion equal to the current ticket price may be locked in exchange for a ticket. | 7
7 | ![Shot 7](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_7.svg) | Locked funds can not be spent for the duration of the ticket lifecycle. The exact length of a specific ticket's life is largely up to chance, but averages about 28 days. | 5 
8 | ![Shot 8](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_8.svg) | A ticket's life starts after it is mined into a block. How long a ticket must wait to be mined is determined by the ticket fee paid when it was purchased. Once included in a block, a ticket is considered immature and must wait about 12 hours before it matures and is added to the ticket pool. | 3 
9 |  ![Shot 9](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_9.svg) | The ticket pool is where mature tickets wait to be chosen to vote. Every 5 minutes, using arbitrary entropy from the blockchain, 5 tickets are randomly drawn from the pool to vote. | 3
10 | ![Shot 10](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_10.svg) | Once their ticket is drawn, a participant's votes are broadcast to the network by their chosen stake voting service for inclusion in the next block. | 5
11 | ![Shot 11](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_11.svg) | There are three on-chain voting processes to participate in: block, consensus, and proposal votes. | 7 
12 | ![Shot 12](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_12.svg) | Block votes provide a mechanism for participants to keep nonconforming proof-of-work miners in check. 5 votes in each new block vote on whether to reject the previous block. If the block is rejected, the the founding miner will not receive their part of the block reward. | 8 
13 | ![Shot 13](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_13.svg) | Consensus votes allow participants to vote for or against changes to the Decred network.  These votes take place over an extended period of time and ratified changes automatically become active. | 5 
14 | ![Shot 14](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_14.svg) | Lastly, Proposals from Politeia, the Decred proposal system, which receive enough upvotes will be put up for an on-chain proposal vote where participants will decide whether the proposed project should receive funding from the network fund. | 7
15 |  ![Shot 15](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_15.svg) | After a participant's ticket has voted, the funds used to purchase the ticket are unlocked | 7 
16 | ![Shot 16](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_16.svg) | and a portion of the block reward is credited to their account. | 4
17 | ![Shot 17](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_17.svg) | This unique proof-of-stake system | 3 
18 | ![Shot 18](../decredStakeVoting/img/shot_18.svg) | allows Decred to operate as an autonomous self-funded digital currency where participants make the rules. | 7
