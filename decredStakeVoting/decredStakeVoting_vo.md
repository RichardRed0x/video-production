## Decred In Depth: Stake Voting
### Voice Over Script

Decred's unique proof-of-stake system allows stakeholders to secure the network, participate in its governance, and change consensus rules by voting with their coins.

To take part in the proof-of-stake voting system, stakeholders lock a portion of their coins in exchange for a ticket. 

All tickets are placed in the ticket pool where they wait to be randomly selected.

Every 5 minutes, 5 tickets are drawn from the pool. 

Once their ticket is drawn, a ticket holder's votes are cast by their chosen vote casting service which provides the infrastructure to ensure votes are broadcast to the network swiftly.

The votes cast by ticket holders are essential to the security and governance of the Decred network. 

The votes mined into each new block check the mining behavior demonstrated in the previous block. If a majority determine this behavior to be unwanted then the block is stripped from the network. 

By rejecting unwanted blocks, stakevoters keep Proof-of-Work miners in check and prevent unwanted chain forks.

Decisions regarding consensus rule changes are also made by voters. Through the on-chain consensus voting system stakeholders have already voted to prepare the network for lightning transactions. 

That's not all.

Ticket holders are granted access to Politeia; Decred's chain-anchored proposal system. Through Politeia, users can participate in Decred self-governance by voting to determine which Decred improvement projects receive funding in a cryptographically verifiable and transparent manner.

After a ticket holder's votes have been cast, the locked coins used to purchase the ticket are returned and the voter reward is credited to their account. They can then choose to purchase another ticket, or spend their funds elsewhere.

Thanks to its unique proof-of-stake voting system, Decred is an autonomous self-funded crypto-currency where stakeholders make the rules.
