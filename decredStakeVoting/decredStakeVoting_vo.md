## Decred In Depth: Stake Voting
### Voice Over Script

Decred's unique proof-of-stake system allows stakeholders to vote with their coins to secure the network and participate in its governance.

To take part in the proof-of-stake voting system, stakeholders purchase 'tickets' by locking a portion of their coins. 

Purchased tickets are placed in the ticket pool where they wait to be randomly selected.

Once a ticket is drawn, the ticket holder's votes are cast by their chosen stake server; a service which provides the infrastructure to ensure votes are broadcast to the network swiftly.

The votes cast by ticket holders are essential to the security and governance of the Decred network. 

The 5 votes mined into each new block determine the validity of the previous one. If the previous block is deemed invalid, the transactions and proof-of-work reward are stripped from the network, punishing the miner for adding an invalid block to the chain. 

Voters, on the other hand, are always rewarded with their share of the block reward. This way voters are compensated for stopping miner attacks and preventing unwanted chain forks by rejecting blocks that break the consensus rules.

Decisions regarding consensus rule changes and network upgrades are also made by voters through an on-chain decision-making system. Through this system stakeholders have already voted to change the algorithm responsible for setting the price of a ticket as well as to prepare the network for lightning transactions. 

What's more, cryptographic ticket "receipts" are used to verify ticket holders and allow them to interface with Politeia; Decred's chain-anchored proposal system. Through Politeia, users can participate in Decred self-governance by voting to determine which Decred improvement projects receive funding from the development fund.

After a ticket holder's various votes have been cast, their locked coins used to purchase their ticket become spendable again and their reward is credited to their account. They can then choose to purchase another ticket, or spend their funds elsewhere.

Thanks to its unique proof-of-stake voting system, Decred is an autonomous self-funded crypto-currency where stakeholders make the rules.
