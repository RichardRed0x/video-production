## Decred: Proof-of-Stake

### Storyboard
**Estimated Runtime:** 03:20

**Transition Style:**
If concurrent scenes contain one or more of the same icons, then they can transitionally "morph" into one another. Otherwise, a simple "blink" on/off transition can be used.

:-: | :----: | :---- | :--:
1 | ![Shot 1](../decredPoS/img/shot_1.svg) | **VO:**<br />Decred Proof-of-stake<br />**action:**<br />Decred logo and PoW icon fade out. Ticket icon moves into position for next scene. | 00:03 
2 | ![Shot 2](../decredPoS/img/shot_2.svg) | **VO:**<br />is an on-chain decision making system<br />**action:**<br />"on-chain" and block icon appear first then "decision" and votes icon. They are then connected by the line. | 00:07 
3 | ![Shot 3](../decredPoS/img/shot_3.svg) | **VO:**<br />Where participants purchase tickets for a chance to have their voice heard.<br />**action:**<br />Wallet icon appears pushing the schematic to the left, followed by the purchase ticket icon, pushing the schematic down. A line connects them and the schematic cycles. | 00:12 
4 | Ultra simplified wireframe of wallet software with `spendable dcr balance`, `current ticket price`, `# owned tickets` and greyed out `purchase ticket` button. | **VO:**<br />to purchase a ticket, participants must have enough Decred to cover the current ticket price.<br />**action:**<br />`spendable balance` and `ticket price` 'sync'. The `balance` is higher than the `price` and the `purchase ticket` button turns from grey to green. | 00:21 
5 | ![Shot 5](../decredPoS/img/shot_5.svg) | **VO:**<br />Every 144 blocks, a new ticket price is calculated by an algorithm to keep the total number of active tickets equal to the target size.<br />**action:**<br />Timer counts up to 144 blocks and activates the algorithm. Price is lowered. Timer counts up again, then price is increased. | 00:32 
6 | Same as scene 4. | **VO:**<br />If the participant's balance is high enough, a portion equal to the current ticket price may be locked in exchange for a ticket. <br />**action:**<br />Purchase ticket button is pressed. `Spendable balance` is subtracted by `ticket price.` `Ticket count` increases by 1. | 00:42 
7 | Send tx view wireframe showing `total balance` and `spendable balance` | **VO:**<br />Locked funds can not be spent for the life of the corresponding ticket.<br />**action:**<br />A tx with an amount less than the total balance but greater than the spendable balance is attempted. An error message appears saying `insufficient spendable funds` | 00:48 
8 | graph of ticket lifespans. `y =% of tickets` `x = days` Shows percentage of tickets that live (or wait to vote) for `x` days. | **VO:**<br />How long a ticket lives in the system is largely up to chance, but averages 30 days.<br />**action:**<br />Graph is drawn out. | 00:56 
9 | ![Shot 9](../decredPoS/img/shot_9.svg) | **VO:**<br />A ticket's life begins after it is mined into a block. How long a ticket must wait to be mined is determined by the transaction fee paid when it was purchased. Once included in a block, a ticket is considered immature and must wait about 12 hours before it becomes live and is added to the ticket pool.<br />**action:**<br />1st half draws out, then emphasis on tx fee. Then second half draws out. Timer counts up to 12 hours. | 01:18 
10 | Ticket pool dice-like interface and timer. | **VO:**<br />The ticket pool is where live tickets wait to be chosen to vote. Every 5 minutes, using arbitrary entropy from the blockchain, 5 tickets are randomly drawn from the pool to vote.<br />**action:**<br />Timer counts up to 5 minutes. 5 tickets are randomly selected from the pool. | 01:31 
11 | Network map with VSPs differentiated from 'normal' nodes. | **VO:**<br />Once their ticket is drawn, a participant's votes are broadcast to the network by their chosen voting service provider for inclusion in the next block.<br />**action:**<br />Votes are broadcast to the network from VSPs changing the map's color. | 01:45 
12 | ![Shot 12](../decredPoS/img/shot_12.svg) | **VO:**<br />There are two on-chain voting processes to participate in: block votes and consensus votes.<br />**action:**<br /> | 01:54 
13 | ![Shot 13](../decredPoS/img/shot_13.svg) | **VO:**<br />Block votes provide a mechanism for participants to keep nonconforming proof-of-work miners in check.<br />**action:**<br />schematic quickly 'cycles' multiple times over duration. | 02:01 
14 | ![Shot 14](../decredPoS/img/shot_14.svg) | **VO:**<br />5 votes in each new block decide whether to reject the previous block. If the block is rejected, the founding miner will not receive their part of the block reward.<br />**action:**<br />Blocks are added voting the previous block yes/no for the duration. `if yes` portion of schematic highlighted when yes signaled, block is greyed out when no. | 02:12 
15 | ![Shot 15](../decredPoS/img/shot_15.svg) | **VO:**<br />Consensus voting is a two stage process where participants vote for or against the implementation of changes to the Decred network.<br />**action:** <br />Schematic 'cycles' slowly. | 02:20 
16 | ![Shot 16](../decredPoS/img/shot_16.svg) | **VO:**<br />if enough nodes upgrade within the upgrade phase interval, voting commences. If 75% of votes signal yes within the voting interval, then the changes are ratified and will be automatically implemented after another block interval.<br />**action:**<br />schematic cycles slowly. Timer counts up as top line is drawn. | 02:36 
17 | wallet 'history' view wireframe listing events related to wallet with `locked balance`, `live tickets`, and `spendable balance` at top. | **VO:**<br /> After a participant's block and consensus votes have been cast, the funds used to purchase the ticket are unlocked and a portion of the block reward is credited to their account.<br />**action:**<br />An event:  `ticket voted` is added. A Timer counts up to 12 hours. Then two pending events: `unlock funds` and `recieve reward ` are added. Timers on the pending events count up to 12 hours after which they initiate. `Spendable balance` counts up to `locked balance` + `reward` while `locked balance` goes to zero. | 02:47 
18 | ![Shot 18](../decredPoS/img/shot_18.svg) | **VO:**<br />Other decisions not involving consensus rule changes, such as how to spend the network treasury are decided through Politeia, the Decred proposal system.<br />**action:**<br />schematic cycles at medium speed. | 02:57 
19 | Pi Voting wireframe showing `# live tickets` and active proposal votes. | **VO:**<br />Through their wallet, participants with live tickets can vote to approve or deny Politeia proposals.<br />**action**<br />Votes are cast for each active proposal. | 03:04 
20 | ![Shot 20](../decredPoS/img/shot_20.svg) | **VO:**<br />To begin participating in Decred proof-of-stake | 03:08 
21 | ![Shot 21](../decredPoS/img/shot_21.svg) | **VO:**<br />download Decrediton at Decred.org | 03:12 
22 | ![Shot 22](../decredPoS/img/shot_22.svg) | **VO:**<br />and purchase Decred at any one of the many supporting exchanges. | 03:17 
23 | ![Shot 23](../decredPoS/img/shot_23.svg) | **VO:**<br />Decred; Decentralized Credits. | 03:20
